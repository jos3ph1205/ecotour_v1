               Hispaniola is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater
               Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island
               in the world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
               Hispaniola is the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas, founded by Christopher
               Columbus on his voyages in 1492 and 1493.

                  <h2>Geography</h2>
               </div>
               <p>
                  Hispaniola is the second largest island of the West Indies, with an area of about 76,126 km². The name
                  given to the island was Columbus. Hispaniola means "small Spain". The Tainos called the island
                  "Quisqueya", Mother Earth.
               </p>
               <p>
                  From a geological point of view, the island of Hispaniola is part of two branches of the North
                  American cordillera system and is about 660 km long, 250 km wide and extends west-easterly. In the
                  west, the island of Hispaniola is separated by the approximately 90 km wide Windward Passage from Cuba
                  and in the east by the Mona Passage from Puerto Rico, which is up to 110 km wide.
               </p>
               <p>
                  On the island of Hispaniola lie five large mountain chains. The highest mountains of the Caribbean are
                  in the Dominican Republic. The highest mountain is in Pico Duarte with 3098 meters above sea level.
                  Also the deepest point of the Caribbean lies on Hispaniola: the salt lake Enriquillo in the southwest
                  of the Dominican Republic.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Hispaniola offers four vegetation zones and five climatic zones. More than 5000 plant species, many of
                  the endemic, make the island a paradise for nature lovers. The animal world is also convincing,
                  although it is not possible to affect large animals except for a few species. For this, the bird world
                  is represented even more arsenically.

                  The island of Hispaniola is divided into two countries Dominican Republic and Haiti. ⅔ the island
                  belongs to the territory of the Dominican Republic and ⅓ Haiti. Although both countries are on an
                  island, the landscape, cultural and social differences are huge.

                  <h2>History</h2>
               </div>
               <p>
                  The island of Hispaniola (La Isla Espanola) was the first colony in the New World settled by Spain.
               </p>
               <p>
                  As such, it served as a logistical base for the conquest of most of the Western Hemisphere.
                  Christopher Columbus first sighted the island in 1492 toward the end of his first voyage to "the
                  Indies".
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
               <p>
                  For two centuries the Spanish ruled the island until western Hispaniola (present-day Haiti) came under
                  French control in 1697. The ease still remained under Spanish control. This created a division that
                  still exists today, with the Dominican Republic and Haiti sharing the island.
               </p>
               <p>Finally, and after the decades of unstable political situations, on 27 February 1844, the territory of
                  Santo Domingo recovered its sovereignty and declared its independence as the Dominican Republic.</p>

                  Wild mountain streams, hidden caves and dreamy waterfalls can be visited on guided tours in the
                  mountains. Walks through tropical mountain forests, biking at the beaches and safaris for bird and
                  bird watching are just a few of the recommendations that we can give you.
